# Hi there, I'm Nelson Bermeo! 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a Student at Stevens Institiute of Technology in the NYC Metropolitan Area studying Computer Science. I am passionate about Machine Learning, Quantum Computing, Software Engineering, Deep Learning, and Mathematics.

## 🚀 About Me

I am dedicated to acquiring new skills both inside and outside the classroom. My goal is to one day contribute to computational projects that make a meaningful impact, whether by curing patients, reducing environmental damage, or addressing other significant challenges. The applications of machine learning are limitless, and I am eager to explore and innovate within this exciting field.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning about Machine Learning.
- 👯 I’m looking for 2025 spring co-op and summer internship/research opportunities.
- 💬 Ask me about navigating Computer Science, I love sharing about my experience to help others. Come to my office hours too at [tbd] and ask me about literally anything I would love to help you.
