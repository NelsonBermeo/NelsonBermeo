# Greetings, I Am Nelson Bermeo! 👋

I'm a Sophmore at Stevens Institiute of Technology in the NYC area studying Computer Science. I am passionate about Machine Learning, Quantum Computing, Software Engineering, Deep Learning, and Mathematics. 

## 🚀 About Me

I have little to no experience in those passions of mine. I have studied the basics of computer science (algorithms, discrete math, calculus, etc) and I am now developing my skills and knowledge in the subfields I mentioned above. I am dedicated to acquiring new skills both inside and outside the classroom. My goal is to one day contribute to computational projects that make a meaningful impact. 

- 🌱 I’m currently on my winter break reading Practical Linear Algebra for Data Science by Mike X Cohen. 
- 👯 I’m looking for 2025 summer internship/research opportunities.
- 💬 If you are a younger student please reach out if you have any questions about anything. 
- 📫 How to reach me: nelsonberm.2005@gmail.com / nbermeo@stevens.edu
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love my family, lifting weights, and studying.
- 💻 Shout out Stevens Computer Science Club @ Stevens I joined as a freshman and learned great things and met amazing people. Gateway South 122 Wednesdays at 9:15.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

My experience is small. It consists of programming assignments - from classes solving problmes like say pascal's triangle or implementing a red black tree in languages python, Java, C, C++, and ARM64 Assembly - and very small solo ventures - like courses from kaggle using Sci-kit Learn and Keras Tensorflow or python for very simple Django sites or typescript + react in guided tutorials. One piece of advice I'd offer is to explore topics and build at least one project you can be proud of you built without a tutorial. I'll build something fun and grand someday but for now I'll read these data science books this winter and take awesome courses in the spring (web dev, software development, bus analysis) and that summer make something awesome; myself or maybe at a company - or both.
